# My Sassy Pet 🐱

My Sassy Pet is a small frontend experiment that simulates a virtual pet with attitude. Its mood changes based on how often you interact with it, using time-based logic and `localStorage`—no backend required.

Feed it or play with it to keep it happy. Ignore it for too long and it will let you know, with sarcastic messages and visual mood changes. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript as a UX and state persistence experiment.

## 🧞 Commands
